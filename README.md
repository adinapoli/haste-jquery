# haste-jquery

haste-jquery is an experimental module to use JQuery with the
Haste compiler. The long term plan is to use this module into a
production environment. For this reason, the code should be of
production-quality level.

## What is supported?
The long term plan is to support all of JQuery's API, but at
the moment only my personal itches has been scratched.

## Contributions
They are very welcome, so please fork away!
Try to follow the code standards, and to try to submit small
PR, in a way that code can be reviewed and integrated properly.
